```- ``` "So your name is Saitama huh?", an ugly fat worker that supposedly to interview Saitama said.

```- ``` "yes sir!", Saitama respond.

```- ``` "you are still young, without any experience in this field, i'm sorry, but you can't work with us.", said the fatty with a creep faint smile.

```- ``` Saitama was like... huh??!! , he just entered this room for about 5 minutes and already been rejected??!! Only 1 question he asked... and that is to confirm he is Saitama??!! what the heck!!

```- ``` Saitama left the room with bitter expersions. Cruel world he live indeed. Then he saw a beutifull woman that came for an interview too, but after only she 6 minutes she get out from the room with a happy expression.

```- ``` Saitama was dumbfolded, cruel world it is. Saitama quickly left the premise.

```- ``` Saitama who were only 21 years old, without any relative to depended on. His achievement in studies is only average. What more, he didn't even managed to find a job after he graduate... He is such a failure.

```- ``` 'Sigh', Saitama could only bitterly go back home.

```- ``` "Aaahhhh!!!!!",  a hysteriacal scream that would could make your ear to bleed was created, after a crab looking monster killed a person after questioning him.

```- ``` "Kukukuku, so it's a brat who did it, he's dead for sure", the monster spoke quitely.

```- ``` While the crab-like monster was killing everyone that in his path, Saitama by chance met him.

```- ``` "Hmm??", the crab-like monster pounder.

```- ``` "Why you din't run away?? Do you wanted to die?? I can see based on your cloth that you a worker right??", the crab monster asked.

```- ``` "Sigh", Saitama really blame himself for having a super bad luck, just now he didn't get a job, and now he by chance met with a monster, what a luck.

```- ``` "Fistly, you are right about one thing, however I'm un-empoleyed, I'm currently in a job hunting, and just now I failed miserably with the interview...", Satama said with a life-less eye.

```- ``` "Heh"
